Requirements for setting up a basic photoshop  program:

User Requirements:
  Non-Functional Requirements:
The program should not be demanding to allow a large range of systems to use it
The program should be fast so that the client(s) will be able to edit photos without having to take breaks waiting for the program to keep up
Should be written so that the program can be easily mapped to a non-confusing UI
The program should be reliable
The program should not be very large

  Functional Requirements:.
The program will take a photo as an input, allow the user to make designated changes, and then the program will change the photo.
The program should be small and able to process the changes quickly
Functions should have an obvious UI counterpart so the client can easily tell what it does
Each stage of the program, from inputting the photograph, to designating the changes to be made, to the execution, should be obvious about what stage it is on, and what is needed to be done to move forward

System Requirements:  
  Non-Functional Requirements:
It should be assumed that the program is being run on a low-budget computer
The changes to the photo shouldnâ€™t take longer than a few seconds
The program should make it clear what is being changed
The program will be consistant in the changes. The program should never make non-designated changes
In order to be run on as many computers as possible, the program should be as small as possible without sacrificing speed

  Functional Requirements:
The program will be able to take in an inputted photo, take inputted changes, and then change them. It will do this in three steps. The user will submit a photo. They will then be able to select what changes they want. The program will then change the photo
The program needs to have a fast and consistent operation time.
The UI will be consistent with what functions the program is on
