Initial Requirements
Requirements for getting the Photoshop program to be able to recognize and remove objects from photographs:

User Requirements:
  Non-Functional Requirements:
The program should not be demanding to allow a large range of systems to use it
The program should be fast so that the client(s) will be able to edit photos without having to take breaks waiting for the program to keep up
Should be written so that the program can be easily mapped to a non-confusing UI
The program should be reliable and only remove the specified objects
The program should not be very large

  Functional Requirements:.
The program will take a photo as an input, allow the user to mark objects they want removed from the photo, and then the program will remove them.
The program should be small and able to process the changes quickly
Functions should have an obvious UI counterpart so the client can easily tell what it does
Each stage of the program, inputting the photograph, marking it, and changing it should be obvious about what stage it is on, and what is needed to be done to move forward

System Requirements:  
  Non-Functional Requirements:
It should be assumed that the program is being run on a low-budget computer
The removal of an object from the photo shouldnâ€™t take longer than a few seconds
The program should make it clear what objects are being highlighted
The program will be consistent with what it removes from the photo. The program should never remove an object that is not designated to be removed
In order to be run on as many computers as possible, the program should be as small as possible without sacrificing speed

  Functional Requirements:
The program will be able to take in an inputted photo, recognize designated objects, and remove them from the photo. It will do this in three steps. The user will submit a photo. They will then be able to select the objects they want removed. The program will then remove those designated objects
The program needs to have a fast and consistent operation time.
The UI will be consistent with what functions the program is on
